I recently acquired Security+ certificate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

After successfully passing the Security+ exam, I’ve pivoted my focus toward hands-on security engineering and incident response. My GitHub serves as my "Proof of Work" showcasing my journey from theory to practice through home labs, script automation, and vulnerability research. I am specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
